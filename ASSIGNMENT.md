# DSCI 554 Group Project

## Description

In this final project, you will create a comprehensive data visualization demo paper as a conference submission. The goal is to design an interactive visualization system or tool that addresses a unique data-driven problem. This project aims to showcase the application of visualization principles and techniques learned in class to provide a solution to a problem. 

### Deliverables

- Paper
- Demonstration 
- Presentation
- Video

### Requirements

- Using Git for version control.
- One of React, Vue.js, or Streamlit is well utilized.
- All pages are well laid out and use Bootstrap.
- All pages and at least one chart are responsive.
- Final product is deployed and publicly accessible (see deployment examples for instructions).
- README.md is updated with the requested information

## Rubric

Students are expected to submit:

1. A research paper about their project as if they were submitting it to a conference for publication. The paper should follow the [LNCS format](http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0), be at most 8 pages long, and include sections on the **introduction, data, approach** (including design, technical considerations, development, and evaluation), **system, related work, conclusions,** and **references**. Each paper should be clearly written, concise, and organized professionally. **Overleaf** is required to write the paper. 
2. A link to the deployed system. Please see the following examples for instructions:
    - [Streamlit](https://dsci-554.streamlit.app/) : [GitHub](https://github.com/dsci-554/streamlit-example)
    - [Vue](https://dsci-554.github.io/vue-example) : [Github](https://github.com/dsci-554/vue-example)
    - [React](https://dsci-554.github.io/react-example) : [Github](https://github.com/dsci-554/react-example)
4. A link to a video demonstration on YouTube. The video should introduce and demonstrate the project. This video should aim to captivate a conference audience and clearly communicate the system's purpose, functionality, and potential impact.
5. A link to your overleaf project for writing the paper.

Students will present the paper to the class as if they were presenting at a conference session, effectively communicating the design choices, contributions, and findings and leveraging the video to provide an overview of the visual display they have built.

| **Category** | **Sophisticated (4-5 pts)** | **Competent (2-3 pts)** | **Needs Work (0-1 pts)** |
|--------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Presentation and Organization** | The paper is exceptionally clear, concise, and logically organized. Language is professional and effectively communicates complex ideas. Figures, tables, and captions are well-integrated and enhance comprehension. | The paper is understandable but may lack conciseness or logical flow. Language is generally clear but may include minor issues. Figures and tables are present but may not fully support the text. | The paper is difficult to follow, poorly organized, and contains multiple unclear sentences. Figures and tables may be missing or confusing. |
| **Clarity of Purpose and Contribution** | The paper explains the purpose and contributions of the project well. The visualization challenges are clearly identified, high-quality references are used to support the project. Are citations relevant, sufficient, and recent? All references are properly cited in LNCS format. Does the conclusion accurately reflect the studyâ€™s findings? Are the implications and possible applications of the findings discussed? Does the paper acknowledge limitations and suggest directions for future research? |  |  |
| **Methodology and Implementation** | The visual display effectively demonstrates the paper's contribution. The visual display design and implementation methods and choices are clearly explained, and explanations on how gen AI was used effectively are provided. The project demonstrates a deep understanding of visualization principles and the use of effective design strategies. |  |  |
| **Project Repository** | Bootstrap and one of React, Vue.js, or Streamlit are well utilized. The project `README.md` provides project documentation and information for others on how to use the demonstration. The project is deployed. |  |  |
| **Presentation** | The presentation is professional and engaging and clearly explains the purpose and contributions of the project. Video clips are presented to showcase the contributions of the paper effectively. Introduction and Motivation. Objectives and Main Contribution. Key Features and Functionality, Challenges and Limitations. Conclusion and Future Work | | |
| **Video** | Effectively highlighting the explains purpose and contributions of the project. Design and technical data and information visualization contributions are demonstrated. The video is less than 5 minutes in length and includes a voice-over. | | |
